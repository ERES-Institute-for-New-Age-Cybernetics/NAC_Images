## 🌐 Overview

Welcome to the **NAC\_Images** repository—an evolving collection of logos, infographics, system diagrams, iconography, and illustrative artwork designed to represent the philosophy, infrastructure, and implementation pathway of **New Age Cybernetics (NAC)**.

NAC is the integrated design framework guiding the 1,000-Year Future Map developed by the [ERES Institute](https://github.com/ERES-Institute-for-New-Age-Cybernetics). This repository serves as a **centralized visual bank** for all assets used in our Substack articles, GitHub projects, ResearchGate publications, public policy letters, and proof-of-work archives.
